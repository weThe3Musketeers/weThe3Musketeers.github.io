                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                        allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                        our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                        to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                        versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                        database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                        to it, still belong to The 3 Musketeers.
                      </p> <p>
                        The 3 Musketeers is committed to ensuring that the app is
                        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                      </p> <p>
                        The Mysuru Commute app stores and processes personal data that
                        you have provided to us, to provide my
                        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                        official operating system of your device. It could make your
                        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                        that the Mysuru Commute app won’t work properly or at all.

                          The app does use third-party services that declare their

                        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                        The 3 Musketeers will not take responsibility for. Certain
                        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                        by your mobile network provider, but The 3 Musketeers
                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                        have any of your data allowance left.
                      </p> <p></p> <p>
                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                        should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                        other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                      </p> <p>
                        Along the same lines, The 3 Musketeers cannot always take
                        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                        The 3 Musketeers cannot accept responsibility.
                      </p> <p>
                        With respect to The 3 Musketeers’s responsibility for your
                        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                        bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                        to you. The 3 Musketeers accepts no liability for any
                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                      </p> <p>
                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                        currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the 
                        both systems(and for any additional systems we
                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. The 3 Musketeers does not promise that it
                        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                        from your device.
